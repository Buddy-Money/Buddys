Donator lets anyone submit a request for donations on the Ethereum network. The system design mirrors familiar social media platforms. Donation Requests fulfill the role of a traditional post. 
Donation Requests include a description and an image. Users can view active Donation Requests and donate to their liking. Donated funds are sent to the Donator smart contract.
The issuer of a Donation Request, known as the Receiver, must accept the funds that were donated to their Donation Request.
A Donator may revoke their donation before a Receiver accepts, causing the donated funds to return to the Donator.
