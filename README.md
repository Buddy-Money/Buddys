Donator lets anyone submit a request for donations on the Ethereum network. The system design mirrors familiar social media platforms. A 'request' fulfills the role of a traditional post. 
'Requests' include a description and an image. 'Donators' can view active 'requests' and donate DON tokens to their liking. Donated DON is sent to the Donator smart contract.
The issuer of a 'request', known as the 'requester', must first accept the DON donated to their 'request' to receive funds.
A 'donator' may revoke their 'donation' before a 'requester' accepts, causing the donated funds to return to the 'donator'.
