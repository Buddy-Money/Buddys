The "Buddys" social media dapp is governed by the BUDD social token. To make a post within Buddys, one must stake BUDD to safeguard against inappropriate content. If a post is deemed inappropriate by the community, its stake is burned, thus increasing the value of BUDD for our community.

At it's heart, BUDD is a meme coin, born out of love for a very special buddy. More so, BUDD has true utility. It functions as a reflective token that rewards community members and a social token that governs the Buddys dapp.

# History

Buddys was first built as the "Donator" dapp. It is being rebranded as "Buddys" as part of the Buddy Money community.
